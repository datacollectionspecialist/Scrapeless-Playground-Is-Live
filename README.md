# Scrapeless-Playground-Is-Live
To further enhance the experience of developers using Scrapeless Scraping Browser for web scraping and browser automation, we are excited to announce the official launch of **Scrapeless Playground**!  

Now you can combine the power of Scraping Browser with a fully visual, interactive Playground interface.

---

## Why Did We Build the Playground?

Scrapeless Scraping Browser already offers a powerful and stable automation environment with support for JavaScript rendering, dynamic content handling, fingerprint customization, and more.

However, we heard a few recurring requests from our users:

> “Can I actually see how the browser runs my tasks?”  
> “I want to quickly test scripts without deploying them every time.”

That’s exactly why we built the Playground:

- ✅ Reusable and stable scraping/browser scripts
- ✅ A visual, interactive browser environment you can **see**, **control**, and **replay**

## ✨ Highlights of This Update

### 1. Brand-New Playground Interface

With this update, users can now directly use the **Scraping Browser** service within the Playground interface. The Playground is divided into two main sections:

- **Code Panel (Left)**: Write and modify your automation scripts.
- **Live Browser Preview (Right)**: Instantly view the browser actions as your script runs. It also supports manual clicks and interactions for real-time debugging.

When no script is running, only the code panel is displayed. Once execution begins, the preview panel is activated—providing a seamless and efficient environment for development and debugging.

### 2. Case Selector for Common Scenarios

In the Playground, we’ve added a new **Browser Cases** feature to help you get started even faster. You can now:

- Quickly select a built-in use case from the dropdown menu (e.g., *Generate PDF*, *Automatic Login*, etc.).
- Automatically load example code for each case — ready for testing right away.
- Start from a **Blank Script** by default for full customization.

> Scrapeless Scraping Browser currently supports a range of advanced features, including:
**Custom Fingerprint**, **reCAPTCHA v2**, **Cloudflare Challenge**, and **Cloudflare Turnstile**.

> 
> Currently supported cases in Playground include:
**Data Scraping**, **Automatic Login**, and **ChatGPT Integration**.

---

**Example: Handling a Cloudflare Challenge**

Let’s walk through an example using the **Cloudflare Challenge** case:

1. Select **Cloudflare Challenge** from the dropdown. The left-side code editor will auto-fill with the relevant script. Click **Run** to execute it and view the real-time process in the right-side browser panel.

2. Once the script finishes running, you can inspect the result in more detail using **Session Replay**. This feature supports adjustable playback speed and lets you review the full session.

 *Note: Each session and its replay data are stored for 7 days.*

3. You can also go to the **Scrapeless dashboard**, click on **Session**, and filter by **Successful** to view your full **Session History**.

### 3.  Enhanced Settings Panel for Personalization

Click the **Settings** button to access a variety of customizable parameters that help tailor your experience in the Playground:

-  **API Key Display**: See which API credential you’re currently using — clear and transparent.
-  **Proxy Selection**: Switch between different proxy lines to better simulate real-world scraping environments.
-  **Max Timeout Setting**: Define the maximum script execution time in minutes. The default is 15 minutes, but it can be extended indefinitely.
-  **Web Recording**: Recording is enabled by default. All your browser interactions will be captured, allowing you to replay sessions later using **Session Replay**.

>  **Note:**  
To use **Session Replay**, you must enable **Web Recording** in the settings panel.  
We highly recommend keeping it **enabled by default** to ensure all browser interactions are recorded properly.
>
>✅ **No extra cost** — Session Replay is included for free with your usage.

### 4. Developer-Friendly Utility Buttons

We’ve also added some helpful utility buttons to improve your development experience:

- **Reset**: Instantly reset the current script to the default template — perfect for quick rollbacks.
-  **Copy**: Copy the current script content with a single click. A toast will confirm: “Code copied successfully”.
-  **Stop**: Manually terminate a running session to avoid hanging or wasting resources.

##  Future Plans

Playground is just one step in Scrapeless’s journey to enhance browser automation quality and productization. Moving forward, the Scrapeless team plans to iterate and upgrade across multiple areas:

### 1. Productization of Scraping Capabilities
- Standardize and productize the three major scraping capabilities: **Scrape**, **Crawl**, and **Extract** to support multi-modal data extraction (text, PDF, documents, images, etc.).
- Upgrade Scraping Browser features, including:
  - Proxy usage tracking  
  - Custom permission configuration  
  - Optimized session replay for file-type sessions

### 2. Developer Ecosystem Expansion
- Launch a **Developer Revenue Sharing Program** to incentivize community contributions such as plugins and use-case templates.

### 3. Infrastructure Strengthening
Scrapeless will continue investing in its core scraping technology stack while enhancing product standardization and developer experience. Our long-term goal is to build an open, scalable, and developer-friendly automation platform.
